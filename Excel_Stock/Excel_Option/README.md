- The simplest method to price the options for this model. This model uses the assumption of perfectly efficient market; however, the model can price the option at each point of a specified time frame. The binomial model, we consider that the price of the underlying asset will either go up or down in the period. Given the possible prices of the underlying asset and the strike price of an option, we can calculate the payoff of the option under these scenarios, then discount these payoffs and find the value of that option as of today.
